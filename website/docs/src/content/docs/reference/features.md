Every Waffled feature and whether it's supported on each surface.

- **Web / Kiosk** — the React app (same build powers the desktop browser and the kitchen
  tablet kiosk).
- **iPhone** — the native iOS app's *personal-planner* experience (`AppRoot` + bottom tab
  bar; one person checking their day).
- **iPad** — the **same** universal app's *family-hub* experience (`KioskRoot` → a left nav
  rail + every page, re-laid-out big; runs on the counter). One binary, one
  [App Store listing](https://apps.apple.com/app/waffled/id6787621452) — the device picks
  the experience by idiom (`DeviceExperience`).
- **Status** — where the feature sits on the [roadmap](https://github.com/kevinpsites/waffled/blob/main/docs/product/roadmap.md).

Legend: ✅ supported · 🟡 partial · 🚧 planned · ❌ not supported / N-A

> **iPhone vs iPad.** Most feature screens are *shared* and adapt by size; the iPad adds
> distinct wide layouts (`KioskDashboard`, `KioskCalendarView`, `KioskListsView`, the
> Kanban chores board, the **screensaver**) on top of the same `SyncManager`/`WaffledAPI`
> data layer. iPad-only items (screensaver, ambient display) read ❌ N/A on iPhone;
> shared-but-web-only admin actions (first-run setup, OIDC config) read ❌ on both.
> The **shared-kiosk profile picker** (pairing + per-profile PIN) now ships on **iPad** as
> an opt-in (single persistent login stays the default); it's ❌ N/A on iPhone, which is
> never a kiosk. See
> [`apps/ios/IPAD_ROADMAP.md`](https://github.com/kevinpsites/waffled/blob/main/apps/ios/IPAD_ROADMAP.md) for the mobile build plan.

| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| First-run **setup wizard** (create household + admin) | ✅ | ❌ N/A | ❌ N/A | ✅ Done — **web/server-only by design**, not planned for mobile (mobile shows a "finish setup on the web" notice) |
| **Dark mode** + Settings → Appearance (Light / Dark / Match system) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — web/kiosk **and** iPhone/iPad share one warm-dark palette (`apps/ios/DARK_MODE.md`) |

| Disable password login / force SSO (break-glass guard) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — config is web/server-only admin by design; every client's login screen honors it (an SSO-only server hides the email/password form on web **and** iPhone/iPad) |

| **Members CRUD** (profiles: name, avatar, color, role, admin, birthday) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done |

## Kiosk & ambient display

## Today dashboard

| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| Today cards: agenda · tonight's meal · this week · chores · grocery | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (iPad = distinct 3-column `KioskDashboard`) |
| **Customize** mode — drag to reorder + **× to hide** cards (hidden collect in a tray to add back) | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | ✅ Done (web + iPhone reorder + hide; a hidden card stays hidden even for module cards; iPad uses layout presets) |

| Month cells show **event titles** (tap a day for times) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done |
| Agenda **dims past events** | ✅ | ✅ | — | ✅ Done — the Calendar agenda **and** the Today dashboard's agenda card fade already-ended events (web + iPhone) |

| **Countdowns** — "N days until X" from three sources (flag an event · standalone item · auto member birthdays); Today card + month-grid badge; household "N sleeps" toggle | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS reads the merged `GET /api/countdowns` for a **Today card** (iPhone `CountdownsCard` + iPad kiosk card; emoji · title · date · N-days/sleeps · standalone × remove · + Add; **tap a standalone row to rename/move/remove**) and **month-grid badges** plus **all-day rows in the iPhone/iPad calendar** (agenda / day / month-detail — a countdown-only day appears in the agenda too; tap to edit: standalone → the editor, event-source → its event); the event editor's **"⏳ Show a countdown"** toggle rides the full `is_countdown` offline path (PowerSync schema + local/REST writes); the **"N sleeps"** toggle is in Settings → Calendars. Web: the Today card countdowns are **tappable** (an event countdown opens its event, a standalone/birthday one opens the calendar day), countdowns render as **all-day chips** in the calendar **day/week** views (on top of the month badge), and **tapping a countdown on the calendar edits it** — a standalone one opens a rename/move/remove editor, an event one opens its event (rename + "Show a countdown" toggle) |

| **Hours + minutes for time goals** — a goal measured in hours takes separate hour/minute fields (no manual "10 min → 0.17"); the server folds them to decimal hours and durations read back as "2h 10m" | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (web + iOS) |
| Create / **edit** / delete goals | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done |
| **Edit / remove a logged entry** (amount, who took part, note, date; shared entries removed whole + re-split) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (web + iOS) |

## Lists & groceries

| Feature | Web / Kiosk | iPhone | iPad | Status |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| Custom **multi-lists** (sectioned items, quantities, assignees) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (iPad = master/detail) |
| Create / rename / delete lists (cascade) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — mobile: **swipe** a list → **Edit** (rename/emoji, `PATCH /api/lists/:id`) + **Delete**; **Delete list** also in the list-detail ⋯ menu |
| **List templates** — save a list as a reusable template, apply → a fresh unchecked copy, manage (delete) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — mobile: one New-list modal (name + emoji + Create) with an "Or start from a template" picker (**select-then-Create**, name pre-fills from the template); long-press a template to delete |
| **Auto-built grocery board** from the week's dinners | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done |
| **Add a recipe's ingredients to the grocery list from its page** — no meal-plan entry needed (one-off dinners, sides, snacks); staples skipped, quantities merged, items linked back to the recipe | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — web: cart icon in the recipe actions (plus the on-hand banner button); mobile: "Add to grocery list" in the recipe ⋯ menu + the banner button |
| **Remove an off-plan recipe from the grocery list** — undo the above; the recipe drops out of the by-meal "Unscheduled" shelf, keeping any items it shares with another recipe | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — web: **Remove** on the by-meal Unscheduled section, or an **×** on the "This week's meals" Unscheduled rail; mobile: long-press the section → **Remove from list** (`DELETE /api/lists/grocery/from-recipe/:id`) |
| **Unscheduled recipe sections in By-meal view** — off-plan recipes group under their own "Unscheduled" header with their own dot color, instead of lumping into "Other items"; they're also listed in the "This week's meals" card below a divider, completing the dot-color legend | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done |
| **Aisle grouping** + **quantity merge** (By aisle / By meal) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done |
| **Pantry staples** (kept off the list; Pantry check) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done |
| Check off / add / delete (persists) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done |
| **Item attribution** — "added by {name}" / "🍽 from meal plan" | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done |
| **Re-aisle** a grocery item (move it to another aisle section from its editor) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — mobile: section chips + an **Auto** chip (clear the override → classify by name) in the item Details editor |
| **Move an item to another section** — refile without opening the full editor: **drag** a row across sections (web drag-and-drop; iPhone/iPad native press-and-drag via `.onMove`, so swipe-to-delete still works); the Details editor also sets the section | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — PATCHes the item's category |
| **Item priority** — set an item's urgency on a **1–5 scale** (1 = not urgent · 3 = normal · 5 = urgent) from its editor; High/Urgent items show a row flag. Setting a priority doesn't reorder the list; a web **Sort: manual ⇄ By priority** toggle flattens it highest-first on demand | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — web + iOS; API stores `priority` (1–5, default 3, mig 0084 + 0085) and returns manual order (priority sort is a client-side opt-in) |
| **Completed section** on a custom list — checked items tuck into a collapsible "Completed" group (with an undo grace window) instead of lingering in place | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — web now matches the grocery board + iOS |
| **Cross-surface live refresh** (Today ↔ Lists ↔ Rewards) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (in-app refresh bus) |

## Meals & recipes

| Feature | Web / Kiosk | iPhone | iPad | Status |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |

| Drag-to-swap on week/month grid | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done |
| Full-screen **recipe detail** (hero image, metadata chips, servings scaler) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done |
| **Total time** on the card (prep + cook); prep/cook split on the detail | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (mobile) |
| **Recipes library** (search-all, multi-select filters, sort) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done |
| **Never-cooked "🆕 New" tag + filter** (recipes you haven't tried) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — mobile: "New" library toggle (`cookedCount == 0`), 🆕 card badge, tappable 🆕 New chip on the detail → library filtered to New |
| Create / **edit** recipes in-app (all metadata + ingredients + steps) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (full editor — shared iPhone/iPad; **per-step ingredient amounts**; **ingredient sections** with dividers + cross-section drag-drop; delete is web-only) |
| **Paste-markdown** recipe import (template/example) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (paste → parse → fills the editor for review, then save) |
| **Share a recipe** as a Markdown file (the inverse of paste-markdown import) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — a **Share** action on the recipe detail compiles the recipe into the blessed Markdown format (`GET /api/recipes/:id/markdown`) and hands it to the platform share options: iOS native share sheet with a `.md` file (Messages / Mail / Save to Files); web `navigator.share`, falling back to copy-to-clipboard + `.md` download. Round-trips back through paste-markdown import |
| Per-recipe **overrides** (substitutions, notes) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — mobile now edits **ingredient substitutions** (⇄ per row → `overrides.subs`, feeds the substitution-aware grocery build) alongside per-step + recipe notes |
| **Cook mode** (step-by-step, wake-lock, finish → mark cooked) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (mobile: left-aligned full-width large type) |
| Cook-mode **recipe overview** (jump to any step + ingredients) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (mobile; large sheet) |

| **On-the-spot cook timer** — add a timer to a step that never had one, mid-cook | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — mobile: "⏱ Add timer" on timer-less steps, minute/second **wheel pickers** (flick to a value), ephemeral for the session |
| Open recipe **full-screen** from Today | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (iPad opens full-screen, not a page-sheet) |
| **Grocery auto-build** honoring substitutions | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done |
| AI **Plan my week / month** (library-only, themes, gaps) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done |
| **Shuffle my week / month** — no-AI fallback for Plan my week & month | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — when no LLM provider is configured, `Plan my week` and `Plan my month` fill the empty dinner slots with random library recipes instead of erroring: skip recipes already planned in that window or cooked in the last ~14 days, leave filled slots untouched, degrade gracefully when the library is small, and return `via:"shuffle"`. Transparent to every client |
| **Try New Recipe** — nudge the AI week toward novelty / list specific dishes to try | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — mobile: "Try something new" toggle + "Dishes to try" chips in the Plan-my-week sheet (sent on the initial full draft) |
| AI **metadata auto-fill** (cuisine, protein, vegetables, tags) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (debounced "✨ Thinking…" in the editor; fills empty fields / suggestion chips) |
| **AI recipe import** — **photo → recipe** and **describe-it** (speech/free-form → recipe) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (web + iOS) — in "New recipe": read photos of a physical recipe with a vision model, or dictate/type a loose description; both prefill the editor for review before saving. Source photos auto-delete after a short window. Photo needs a vision provider (Claude / OpenAI / vision Ollama); describe works with any. iOS uses the device camera / photo library and on-device Apple Speech dictation; the two import buttons appear only when the household's provider supports them |
| **Conversational recipe edits** ("make it gluten-free", "double it") | 🚧 | 🚧 | 🚧 | 🚧 Planned |

## Photos & memories

| Capture a **reward** ("add a reward: ice cream night for 50 stars") | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (parses the star/point cost, editable; needs Rewards enabled **and** the `reward.manage` capability — kids see "ask a parent") |
| **Do things**, not just add ("mark the trash chore done", "give the dishes to Wally", "log 20 min on my reading goal", "move soccer to Thursday 4pm", "cross off milk", "redeem movie night") | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (Tier 2 mutate verbs, all surfaces). Resolves the thing by description (pick-one when ambiguous), server-only, destructive actions confirm. Verbs: **complete / reassign a chore**, **log goal progress**, **reschedule / cancel an event** (one occurrence, never the whole series), **check off / remove a list item**, and **redeem a reward**. **Best with an AI provider** — without one the on-device parser handles common phrasings only (the preview flags it). Not every verb works on every kind yet |
| Capture parses **event recurrence** + edit Repeats/Ends in the preview | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done ("lunch every Thursday for a month" → RRULE) |
| **Pluggable provider** (Anthropic / OpenAI-compatible / Ollama), per household | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done |
| Instant on-device parse, then **upgrade to LLM** with a provider tag | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (instant guess + "improving…"; **pick** the other take on a kind-disagreement; **recurrence backfill** when a weak LLM drops it) |
| **Heuristic fallback** (offline / no provider / provider defers) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (on-device `CaptureHeuristic` — capture works with no server; ported from web `parse.ts`, kept in sync) |
| Household-local "now" + family names for resolution | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done |
| Server-side **fuzzy person resolution** (nicknames/aliases) | 🚧 | 🚧 | 🚧 | 🚧 Planned (6.6-names) |

## Notifications

| Feature | Web / Kiosk | iPhone | iPad | Status |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| **Kiosk "due soon"** reminder banner (local, while open) | 🚧 | ❌ N/A | ❌ N/A | 🚧 Planned (web; table not built) |
| iOS **local** event reminders (offline, from local mirror) | ❌ N/A | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (mobile) |
| Snooze / View notification actions | ❌ N/A | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (mobile) |
| Reminder settings (lead time, all-day hour, my-events-only) | ❌ N/A | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done (mobile) |
| Chore reminders | ❌ N/A | 🚧 | 🚧 | 🚧 Planned (needs chores in PowerSync) |
| Recurring-event reminders | ❌ N/A | 🚧 | 🚧 | 🚧 Planned (no recurrence in scheduler yet) |
| **Remote push (APNs / web-push)** | 🚧 | 🚧 | 🚧 | 🚧 Planned (blocked on key/relay) |

## Modules & extensibility

See [Extensibility & modules](/concepts/extensibility/) for the pattern model (A = built-in toggle
module · B = external integration via API keys · C = in-process plugins, deliberately not
built). The on/off flag is **server-side + shared** (`households.settings.modules`); each
client renders its own native UI, so a module with no iOS screen simply doesn't appear there.

| Feature | Web / Kiosk | iPhone | iPad | Status |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| **Pluggable optional modules** — registry + per-household enable flag; gates Today cards / nav / routes | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS now gates the **Chores/Goals/Meals/Lists** nav (phone hub tiles + Meals tab; iPad rail), their Today cards, and the **Rewards** sub-toggle on the shared flag (Today + Calendar never gated) |
| **Settings → Modules** tab (toggle optional modules on/off) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS `ModulesSettingsView` (admin-gated toggles + Rewards sub-toggle + "coming soon" rows); toggling updates nav/Today live |
| **Pantry / on-hand inventory** module — items + quantities + locations (fridge/freezer/pantry) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS `PantryView` (list grouped by location, add by hand, edit/used-up/delete) |
| Pantry: quantity **stepper** + tap-to-type amount, **"used up"** state | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS: ± stepper on rows/detail/scan (stepping below 1 marks used up) |
| Pantry: **drag items between locations**; **Today card** (whole-card tap, mark-used) | ✅ | 🟡 | 🟡 | ✅ Done (web); mobile: **Pantry Today card now ships** (use-soon + running-low, "N on hand · M soon", taps into Pantry — iPhone card + iPad `kioskPantryCard`, module-gated); change location from the editor (**no drag** yet) |
| Pantry: **redesigned list** (location sidebar + counts, search, sort), **item detail** sheet | ✅ | 🟡 | 🟡 | ✅ Done — iOS matches the web: sidebar (chips on iPhone) of All/Use-soon/Running-low + locations, search, Expiring/A–Z/Recent sort, card grid + item detail |
| Pantry: **Open Food Facts** integration — barcode lookup (cached), nutrition + allergen snapshots, **"may contain" traces**, **dietary flags** (vegan/vegetarian/palm-oil-free), **replace photo** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS scan/type → `GET /api/pantry/lookup` → Found sheet → add (nutrition + allergen + traces snapshot ride onto the item; replace-photo on detail); **dietary flags** (Vegan / Vegetarian / Palm-oil-free) now render as green chips on the item detail |
| Pantry: **allergen warnings** — household avoid-list ∪ per-person allergens, colored letter badges + persistent key, red-ring on avoided, "affects X" | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS **colored allergen badges** (G/D/S…, red ring when avoided) on cards + a legend; "Contains" / "⚠ Affects {people}" + "may contain" traces on the detail; the **household avoid-list** is now editable in **Settings → Pantry** (chip multi-select) |
| Pantry: **running-low threshold** (household default + per-item), **per-location icons** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS **Low** badge off the threshold + **per-location icons** in the sidebar; **Settings → Pantry** now edits the household running-low default, the **locations** (add/rename/remove/reorder), and their **per-location icons** (`PUT /api/pantry/config`); only the *per-item* threshold override stays web-only |
| Pantry: **item age** — added/bought date (distinct from expiry), household-customizable "old" threshold, "Been a while" group + "Oldest" sort, age chip | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS: 🕰️ age chip on old rows + a "{age} ago" chip on the detail's **Added** row, a **Been a while** sidebar/chip filter, an **Oldest** sort, and a backdatable "Added / bought" date in the editor. Reads the household `staleMonths` from the server; the **"old" threshold is now editable** in **Settings → Pantry** |
| Pantry: **barcode camera scanner** — point at a barcode | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS **native AVFoundation scanner** (EAN/UPC/Code128…) + a "Type instead" fallback for the simulator/denied camera; **no HTTPS constraint** (web uses zxing, needs a secure context) |
| Pantry ↔ meals: **Cook from your pantry** — recipes makeable now (staple-aware), on-hand **proteins as "mains"** → filtered recipe library, leftovers ("It's a meal"), **Plan my week** seeded with soon-to-expire, per-item **Plan it in** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS `CookFromPantryCard` in the Pantry surface (meals-gated) opens a self-contained modal with all five sections: Plan-my-week banner → seeded `PlanWeekSheet`; **Tonight · no cooking** leftovers with **Ate it** (consume) + **Plan** into a slot (planned-state derived from `/api/meals/week`); **You have everything** (`/api/pantry/cookable` `ready`) → recipe detail / Cook Mode; **You have the main** proteins → protein-filtered library + near-makeable recipes + **+ List** grocery add; **Use up soon** chips |
| Pantry ↔ meals: **cook → decrement** — marking a recipe cooked opens a "Used from your pantry" confirm sheet (Used some / Used it up / Didn't use; staples skipped) that decrements or uses-up stock; leftovers get **"Ate it"**; cooking flips today's planned slot to cooked | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS: marking a recipe cooked (button or Cook Mode finish) fetches `/api/pantry/for-recipe` and, when it matches on-hand items, shows a `CookConfirmSheet` (server-suggested defaults) that POSTs `/api/pantry/consume`. Plan-slot flip is the server's free side-effect of `markCooked`. Leftovers **"Ate it"** ships in the Cook-from-pantry surface |
| **Family Night** module — recurring family gathering (default Mon) with a customizable agenda of "parts" that **auto-rotate** among members (override per week); **Today card** with per-part person pickers; admin agenda/day/time editor; optional weekly **calendar event** (auto-routes to owner's ★ default → Google when connected) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS ships the module (opt-in in Settings → Modules): a **Today card** (iPhone `FamilyNightCard` + iPad `kioskFamilyNightCard`) showing the next gathering's date + per-part **person-picker** (overrides this week's rotation via `POST /occurrence`), and a **Settings → Family Night** admin editor (weekday · time · "show on the calendar" schedule/unschedule · agenda parts CRUD). Entirely REST off `/api/family-night`. Phase 2 (web): history, recipe/goal links, idea bank |
| **Waffled-Bites** module — pair a kid's companion touchscreen device (Family → kid → Waffled-Bite) and control it live: quiet-time countdown (start/pause/+5/end), night light (color + brightness), per-day wake-up light schedule (yellow "almost time" warning + green go-time), morning alarm, sound machine, screen brightness, and a device-side timer/bedtime preview | ✅ | 🚧 | 🚧 | 🟡 Partial — pairing + parent control panel done (web); the on-device app (ESP32-P4 + LVGL) is also code-complete and proven against the real backend, but **only in a desktop simulator** — the physical board has never been in hand for real hardware bring-up, so it's pending validation before an actual device exists; iOS control panel coming soon (web ships first) |
| **Public API keys + scopes** — `waffled_…` key, `x-api-key`, `<resource>:read\|write` scopes | ✅ | ❌ N/A | ❌ N/A | ✅ Done (web; build #3) — external-integration surface (pattern B), admin-issued |
| **Settings → API Keys** tab (generate / scope / reveal-once / revoke) | ✅ | ❌ N/A | ❌ N/A | ✅ Done (web; admin-gated) |

> **PowerSync scope note.** Offline-first currently covers the **calendar/events** domain
> on every surface (local-first reads + queued writes). The iOS app mirrors
> persons/events/event_participants/households locally. Other domains (chores, lists,
> rewards, goals, meals, photos) are REST-backed and need connectivity, kept in sync by
> the in-app live-refresh bus while online. Bringing **chores** into PowerSync is the
> prerequisite for offline chores *and* iOS chore reminders.

## Mobile backlog (planned, not yet built)

Tracked in [`apps/ios/IPAD_ROADMAP.md`](https://github.com/kevinpsites/waffled/blob/main/apps/ios/IPAD_ROADMAP.md). Highlights:

- **Chore reminders** on iOS — blocked on chores landing in PowerSync.
- **Recurring-event reminders** — the local scheduler doesn't expand recurrences yet.
- ~~**Multi-profile kiosk** (profile picker + per-person PIN) on iPad~~ — **shipped** as an
  opt-in shared-kiosk mode (single-login stays the default). See IPAD_ROADMAP Phase 6.
- ~~iPad Today per-card customize (drag/hide)~~ — intentionally not planned; the fixed
  three-group dashboard (recap banners · Today · goals) is the right shape for the wall display.
- **Household-wide** screensaver motion (currently a per-device toggle; would need the
  server display config + web to carry a `photoMotion` field).
- **Remote push** (APNs) for reminders when the app is closed.
- **Waffled-Bites control panel** — coming soon; web ships first, iOS is a planned
  fast-follow once the web panel (and the physical device) have proven the shape out.

See [roadmap status](https://github.com/kevinpsites/waffled/blob/main/docs/product/roadmap.md) for the cross-surface planned/partial items in context.
