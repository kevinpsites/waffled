Every Waffled feature and whether it's supported on each surface.

- **Web / Kiosk** — the React app (same build powers the desktop browser and the kitchen
  tablet kiosk).
- **iPhone** — the native iOS app's *personal-planner* experience (`AppRoot` + bottom tab
  bar; one person checking their day).
- **iPad** — the **same** universal app's *family-hub* experience (`KioskRoot` → a left nav
  rail + every page, re-laid-out big; runs on the counter). One binary, one App Store
  listing — the device picks the experience by idiom (`DeviceExperience`).
- **Status** — where the feature sits on the [roadmap](https://github.com/kevinpsites/waffled/blob/main/docs/product/roadmap.md).

Legend: ✅ supported · 🟡 partial · 🚧 planned · ❌ not supported / N-A

> **iPhone vs iPad.** Most feature screens are *shared* and adapt by size; the iPad adds
> distinct wide layouts (`KioskDashboard`, `KioskCalendarView`, `KioskListsView`, the
> Kanban chores board, the **screensaver**) on top of the same `SyncManager`/`WaffledAPI`
> data layer. iPad-only items (screensaver, ambient display) read ❌ N/A on iPhone;
> shared-but-web-only admin actions (first-run setup, OIDC config) read ❌ on both.
> The **shared-kiosk profile picker** (pairing + per-profile PIN) now ships on **iPad** as
> an opt-in (single persistent login stays the default); it's ❌ N/A on iPhone, which is
> never a kiosk. See
> [`apps/ios/IPAD_ROADMAP.md`](https://github.com/kevinpsites/waffled/blob/main/apps/ios/IPAD_ROADMAP.md) for the mobile build plan.

## Modules & extensibility

See [Extensibility & modules](/concepts/extensibility/) for the pattern model (A = built-in toggle
module · B = external integration via API keys · C = in-process plugins, deliberately not
built). The on/off flag is **server-side + shared** (`households.settings.modules`); each
client renders its own native UI, so a module with no iOS screen simply doesn't appear there.

| Feature | Web / Kiosk | iPhone | iPad | Status |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| **Pluggable optional modules** — registry + per-household enable flag; gates Today cards / nav / routes | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS now gates the **Chores/Goals/Meals/Lists** nav (phone hub tiles + Meals tab; iPad rail), their Today cards, and the **Rewards** sub-toggle on the shared flag (Today + Calendar never gated) |
| **Settings → Modules** tab (toggle optional modules on/off) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS `ModulesSettingsView` (admin-gated toggles + Rewards sub-toggle + "coming soon" rows); toggling updates nav/Today live |
| **Pantry / on-hand inventory** module — items + quantities + locations (fridge/freezer/pantry) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS `PantryView` (list grouped by location, add by hand, edit/used-up/delete) |
| Pantry: quantity **stepper** + tap-to-type amount, **"used up"** state | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS: ± stepper on rows/detail/scan (stepping below 1 marks used up) |
| Pantry: **drag items between locations**; **Today card** (whole-card tap, mark-used) | ✅ | 🟡 | 🟡 | ✅ Done (web); mobile: change location from the editor (no drag); **no Pantry Today card yet** |
| Pantry: **redesigned list** (location sidebar + counts, search, sort), **item detail** sheet | ✅ | 🟡 | 🟡 | ✅ Done — iOS matches the web: sidebar (chips on iPhone) of All/Use-soon/Running-low + locations, search, Expiring/A–Z/Recent sort, card grid + item detail |
| Pantry: **Open Food Facts** integration — barcode lookup (cached), nutrition + allergen snapshots, **"may contain" traces**, **dietary flags** (vegan/vegetarian/palm-oil-free), **replace photo** | ✅ | 🟡 | 🟡 | ✅ Done — iOS scan/type → `GET /api/pantry/lookup` → Found sheet → add (nutrition + allergen + traces snapshot ride onto the item; replace-photo on detail); **dietary flags** not surfaced on iOS yet |
| Pantry: **allergen warnings** — household avoid-list ∪ per-person allergens, colored letter badges + persistent key, red-ring on avoided, "affects X" | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS **colored allergen badges** (G/D/S…, red ring when avoided) on cards + a legend; "Contains" / "⚠ Affects {people}" + "may contain" traces on the detail |
| Pantry: **running-low threshold** (household default + per-item), **per-location icons** | ✅ | 🟡 | 🟡 | ✅ Done (web); mobile: **Low** badge off the threshold + **per-location icons** in the sidebar; no per-item/per-location *config* UI yet |
| Pantry: **item age** — added/bought date (distinct from expiry), household-customizable "old" threshold, "Been a while" group + "Oldest" sort, age chip | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS: 🕰️ age chip on old rows + a "{age} ago" chip on the detail's **Added** row, a **Been a while** sidebar/chip filter, an **Oldest** sort, and a backdatable "Added / bought" date in the editor. Reads the household `staleMonths` from the server; **no iOS threshold-config editor yet** (all pantry config is read-only on iOS) |
| Pantry: **barcode camera scanner** — point at a barcode | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS **native AVFoundation scanner** (EAN/UPC/Code128…) + a "Type instead" fallback for the simulator/denied camera; **no HTTPS constraint** (web uses zxing, needs a secure context) |
| Pantry ↔ meals: **Cook from your pantry** — recipes makeable now (staple-aware), on-hand **proteins as "mains"** → filtered recipe library, leftovers ("It's a meal"), **Plan my week** seeded with soon-to-expire, per-item **Plan it in** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS `CookFromPantryCard` in the Pantry surface (meals-gated) opens a self-contained modal with all five sections: Plan-my-week banner → seeded `PlanWeekSheet`; **Tonight · no cooking** leftovers with **Ate it** (consume) + **Plan** into a slot (planned-state derived from `/api/meals/week`); **You have everything** (`/api/pantry/cookable` `ready`) → recipe detail / Cook Mode; **You have the main** proteins → protein-filtered library + near-makeable recipes + **+ List** grocery add; **Use up soon** chips |
| Pantry ↔ meals: **cook → decrement** — marking a recipe cooked opens a "Used from your pantry" confirm sheet (Used some / Used it up / Didn't use; staples skipped) that decrements or uses-up stock; leftovers get **"Ate it"**; cooking flips today's planned slot to cooked | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Done — iOS: marking a recipe cooked (button or Cook Mode finish) fetches `/api/pantry/for-recipe` and, when it matches on-hand items, shows a `CookConfirmSheet` (server-suggested defaults) that POSTs `/api/pantry/consume`. Plan-slot flip is the server's free side-effect of `markCooked`. Leftovers **"Ate it"** ships in the Cook-from-pantry surface |
| **Family Night** module — recurring family gathering (default Mon) with a customizable agenda of "parts" that **auto-rotate** among members (override per week); **Today card** with per-part person pickers; admin agenda/day/time editor; optional weekly **calendar event** (auto-routes to owner's ★ default → Google when connected) | ✅ | 🚧 | 🚧 | ✅ Done (web) — `family_night_occurrences`/`_assignments`, config in `settings.familyNight`; renamed from the "FHE" stub to stay generic. Phase 2: history, recipe/goal links, idea bank |
| **Public API keys + scopes** — `waffled_…` key, `x-api-key`, `<resource>:read\|write` scopes | ✅ | ❌ N/A | ❌ N/A | ✅ Done (web; build #3) — external-integration surface (pattern B), admin-issued |
| **Settings → API Keys** tab (generate / scope / reveal-once / revoke) | ✅ | ❌ N/A | ❌ N/A | ✅ Done (web; admin-gated) |

> **PowerSync scope note.** Offline-first currently covers the **calendar/events** domain
> on every surface (local-first reads + queued writes). The iOS app mirrors
> persons/events/event_participants/households locally. Other domains (chores, lists,
> rewards, goals, meals, photos) are REST-backed and need connectivity, kept in sync by
> the in-app live-refresh bus while online. Bringing **chores** into PowerSync is the
> prerequisite for offline chores *and* iOS chore reminders.

## Mobile backlog (planned, not yet built)

Tracked in [`apps/ios/IPAD_ROADMAP.md`](https://github.com/kevinpsites/waffled/blob/main/apps/ios/IPAD_ROADMAP.md). Highlights:

- **Chore reminders** on iOS — blocked on chores landing in PowerSync.
- **Recurring-event reminders** — the local scheduler doesn't expand recurrences yet.
- ~~**Multi-profile kiosk** (profile picker + per-person PIN) on iPad~~ — **shipped** as an
  opt-in shared-kiosk mode (single-login stays the default). See IPAD_ROADMAP Phase 6.
- ~~iPad Today per-card customize (drag/hide)~~ — intentionally not planned; the fixed
  three-group dashboard (recap banners · Today · goals) is the right shape for the wall display.
- **Household-wide** screensaver motion (currently a per-device toggle; would need the
  server display config + web to carry a `photoMotion` field).
- **Remote push** (APNs) for reminders when the app is closed.

See [roadmap status](https://github.com/kevinpsites/waffled/blob/main/docs/product/roadmap.md) for the cross-surface planned/partial items in context.
